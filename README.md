# CS499R - Machine Learning for Computer Graphics

This is a seminar course with a majority of the lecture time devoted to student-led presentations. In each session, a student will present and critique one or two assigned papers related to the term's topic. They will discuss the paper or papers, and offer their own thoughts about what could have been done differently and how the work could be extended. The rest of the students are expected to read the papers, attend the presentations, and participate in the following discussion. Students who take the course for credit are also expected to complete a small project at the end of the term.
